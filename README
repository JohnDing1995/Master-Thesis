# right hand pages.

The MSc-thesis should be written in british-english. The report should be
built using LaTeX. A very good way of learning LaTeX is by using it, while
keeping the "Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX" nearby.

You are provided with an template, which should be used for writing your 
final thesis. In this template, some example are given for certain common 
constructions in MSc theses. Additionally, some guidelines are provided in 
the files for writing.

The Makefile can be used to do the following things:
  make            DVI-file is compiled
  make pdf        PDF-file is compiled
  make spell      all TEX-files are spellchecked with british-english

Advice and common mistakes for the english language itself can be found at:

Some other things:
  use "are not" instead of "aren't" (in general: do not use an apostrophe)
  talk with others about using LaTeX, this is easier, faster and more fun!
  use BiBTeX for your bibliography: examples are given in the bib-directory
