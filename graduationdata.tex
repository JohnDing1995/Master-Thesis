    %In the traditional software development life cycle, development and operation are divided into different departments. The conflict between departments and, besides, the lack of automation usually leads to low software development efficiency and slow software delivery. Thus, the concept of DevOps which combines different departments and automate the process emerges. There are various DevOps platforms provided by different vendors To help the companies migrate to DevOps. To help the company select the suitable DevOps platform, it's important to analyse the needs of the company's side. The thesis project investigates what is the demand from the company on DevOps platform. This is being done by [TODO: How to get this, literature survey?]. Besides, the project compares main DevOps platforms which are being used in the projects of Eficode. The first part of the comparison is from the quantitative perspective. We compare the performance and quality of the software delivery pipeline of tested platforms by deploying a sample [TODO: What kind of application] application through the same continuous delivery model deployed on the different DevOps platforms. Furthermore, we also compared the cost of the different platform in the same testing. The second part of the comparison is from the functionality perspective. In this part, whether these platforms satisfy the need from the team which adopting DevOps is being analysed.
