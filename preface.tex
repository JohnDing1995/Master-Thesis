Helping costumers transform to DevOps is one of the main business activity of Eficode, and DevOps toolchain is one of the key elements during the transformation process.
On the other hand, as an advanced partner of multiple cloud providers, Eficode is interested in what cloud technologies could bring to the DevOps toolchain. In this thesis project, I focus on the AWS serverless platform\footnote{https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/} in Amazon Web Services and discover what change, especially benefit can it bring to DevOps toolchain.

The process of doing this project is not an easy task; the set up of cloud infrastructure requires an enormous number of operational and configuration tasks. The vast but unregulated plugin eco-system of Jenkins also leads problems such as lack of documentation for plugin, dependency hell and unstable plugin. There is a lack of previous researches about the serverless within DevOps toolchain. Moreover, as a student with a software development background, the lack of prior experiences in the related field means much study is needed before I can start the project. All these tedious and unexpected tasks above, plus the tight thesis schedule did make me frustrating in the middle phase of this project. Despite all of these, I managed to achieve the preset goal by answering all RQs and finish the demo implementations. Through this project, I familiar with different exciting tools for cloud and DevOps; it opens up a whole new area for me, and will help me with my future career in Eficode. I hope the result will give Eficode more insight on the capability that AWS serverless platform could bring for the DevOps toolchain.

Now I'm at the end of this two year's journey, and I feel grateful that I made this life-changing decision to come and study in Europe. I have to say, it was not an easy decision to quite the ongoing research master's study back in Shanghai, China and start all over again in a brand new environment. The two year's study was a journey full of struggle -- in both financial and study. However, what it brings is more than what I expected: international experiences by EIT Digital, great friends from different countries, two intern/work experiences, and precious knowledge that combines business and technologies. Most importantly, I could study the topic that I'm interested in and start a career within this field, which I was not able to do that back in my research master's study in China.

I sincerely thanks my supervisor Mikko Drocan from Eficode, Prof.dr.ir. D.H.J. Epema from TU Delft for their guidance and support in writing during this unprecedented time. Thanks for Eficode for giving me this precious opportunity and sponsoring this thesis project. Thanks for the scholarship from EIT Digital master school, which I can't finish the two-year's master's study without it. Lastly, special thanks to the thesis support team in Eficode for getting the weekly support on my thesis writing, and Eficode IT for providing the cloud sandbox environment.
